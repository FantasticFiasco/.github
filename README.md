# Default (root) GitHub project

GitHub supports a default project with files that are inherited by all other projects, unless they specify their own files that override the default.

For more information, please see [Creating a default community health file](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
